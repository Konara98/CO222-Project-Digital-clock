# Digital Clock Project (CO222)

## Objective:
Developed a digital clock for the Linux terminal with features like color output based on command-line arguments and error handling.
  
## Technologies Used: 
Utilized C programming with a focus on arrays, loops, functions, and ANSI escape codes for text coloring.

## Problem-Solving: 
Broke down the project into subproblems such as system time retrieval and character color assignment, leading to a modular and efficient code structure.

## Coding Practices: 
Adhered to good coding practices, ensuring error-free compilation and execution in a Linux environment.
